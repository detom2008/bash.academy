## What to Use Bash Academy For
===============================

Bash academy can be used in the following manner:

1. As a self-teaching resource for anyone needing to learn how to use the bash shell or learning to apply shell concepts *properly*. This includes beginners or people who are not very familiar with intricacies of bash.

2. As a reference for bash users to look up syntax and clarify uses for specific commands.

3. As a teaching aid for anyone teaching others how to use bash properly. 


## When to Use Bash Academy and How to Use It
=============================================

 [Bash Academy](bash.academy) can be [downloaded to a local storage medium](https://github.com/lhunath/bash.academy) and accessed via a web browser. Alternatively, one can host on a web server and make it available to other users, for example students.
	
 Bash Academy can be used whilst using the bash shell to look up commands via the easy-to-navigate interface. For teaching or learning purposes one can work through the respective sections in the order they have been presented or jump to a specific section which one wants to learn depending on one's individual needs. The section on [bash games](play.bash.academy) is a valuable and effective tool for revising concepts, testing one's skills and committing them to memory.

The Bash Academy platform also allows content to be easily edited and extended so teachers can update content if they need to do so. If one is using it as a reference, extra notes, caveats and snippets can be typed in for easy access later when the need might arise.
