The Bash Academy

The Bash Academy is an initiative to promote the bash shell language and educate people on its use. For the uninitiated, bash can have a bad reputation (and quickly too!). We aim to delete the air of mystery surrounding bash so you can embrace it more daily even as a casual computer user. For example, how often have you thought about making the folders on your computer more organised? And then, after some thought, put it off when you realised you'd also need to rename quite a few of them. A simple bash script would spare you the headache but you didn't know that. So you chose to leave your computer cluttered.

Then you heard and read that *bash is hard* and is strictly for nerdy types who enjoy staring at dark screens for an eternity. For you, that meant no fun. But is it really the case that bash is hard to grasp, no fun, and not for everyone?

How about the ability to make your computer do things that seem magical? True, bash has its roots in Unix culture, but [regardless of your operating system you can use bash](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/) along with this gentle guide.
